    <p style="font-family:'Comfortaa';font-size:x-large; color:#F1F194 ; padding: 25px;">Our ancient Indian Sciences have become endangered with the modern world developing leaps and bounds in short time. 'Prakruti' is an attempt to revive our Indian sciences to the name and fame of the past while at the same time stay up to date with the latest medical advancements. We strongly believe in debunking myths that surround home remedies in the name of 'traditional sciences'. At Prakruti, we follow guidelines laid out by The Ministry of Ayush, Government of India and promote qualified practitioning of Ayush.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Comfortaa';font-size:x-large; color:#F1F194 ; padding: 25px;">'Prakruti' has taken up the humble initiative to increase the reach of certified Ayush practitioners to a wider array of people by creating a medium that will help people connect with practitioners in a hassle-free manner. By enabling online consultations, we aim to lower in-person interactions during the course of a pandemic. Moreover, 'Prakruti' enables pharmacies to directly deliver prescribed medicines to patients in need without the intervention of the patient at any point, making the entire process simpler!</p>

Ayuh means life and Veda means knowledge or science. Thus 'Ayurveda' in totality means ‘Science of life’. It incorporates all aspects of life whether physical, psychological, spiritual or social. What is beneficial and what is harmful to life, what is happy life and what is sorrowful life; all these four questions and life span allied issues are elaborately and emphatically discussed in Ayurveda. It believes the existence of soul before birth and after death too.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Comfortaa';font-size:x-large; color:#F1F194 ; padding: 25px;"><strong>Yoga</strong> is one of the six systems of Vedic philosophy. It is believed to have a potential for improvement of physical health by enhancing circulation of oxygenated blood in the body, retraining the sense organs thereby inducing tranquility and serenity of mind.

<p style="font-family:'Comfortaa';font-size:x-large; color:#F1F194 ; padding: 25px;">The <strong>Unani</strong> System of Medicine has a long and impressive record in India. It was introduced in India by the Arabs and Persians sometime around the eleventh century. Today, India is one of the leading countries in so for as the practice of Unani medicine is concerned. It has the largest number of Unani educational, research and health care institutions.The foundation of Unani system was laid by Hippocrates. The system owes its present form to the Arabs who not only saved much of the Greek literature by rendering it into Arabic but also enriched the medicine of their day with their own contributions. In this process they made extensive use of the science of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Therapeutics and Surgery.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Comfortaa';font-size:x-large; color:#F1F194 ; padding: 25px;"><strong>Siddha</strong> system is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India . The term Siddha means achievements and Siddhars were saintly persons who achieved results in medicine. Eighteen Siddhars were said to have contributed towards the development of this medical system. Siddha literature is in Tamil and it is practised largely in Tamil speaking part of India and abroad. The Siddha System is largely therapeutic in nature.</p>

In India it has become a household name due the safety of its pills and gentleness of its cure. A rough study states that about 10% of the Indian population solely depend Homoeopathy for their Health care needs and is considered as the Second most popular system of medicine in the Country.</p>
