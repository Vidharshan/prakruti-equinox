                               PROJECT DESCRIPTION - PRAKRUTI WEBSITE (Based on AYUSH India)

## Inspiration
Our ancient Indian Sciences have become endangered with the modern Sciences developing leaps and bounds in short time.  So, we wish to revive our Indian Sciences to the name and fame of the past.

## What it does
This is a website to connect doctors, patients and pharmacies in the AYUSH sector with the society. Patients get to consult doctors with the problems they have so that doctors can advise them on what are the remedies and steps to be followed to get cured. The doctor then prescribes medicines to the nearest pharmacy with the necessary details. The pharmacy receives the orders and confirms it with the patient to whom the medicines were prescribed.

## How we built it
We built the website using a set of languages such as HTML5, CSS, PHP and MYSQL. It was a teamwork wherein every team member contributed segments to the project in which he/she was comfortable in. 

## Challenges we ran into
Initially we did not have much of an idea on how to deal server-side scripting languages and databases. Another problem we faced was same pages were viewed differently on different systems and browsers which caused slight confusions while proceeding with the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to learn many features of the server-side scripting languages before they were actually taught to us. We were able to promote the AYUSH sector to the best of our ability helping it gain its lost fame and popularity. 

## What we learned
We learnt how to work in a team (team delegation, knowledge about every member of the team and so on). We also learnt about the Indian medical Sciences to a great extent. 

## What's next for Prakruti
We would like to expand our website on an international level, making people all over the world recognize the value of our ancient Indian Sciences in terms of how to live life with affordable and home-made remedies for majority of the diseases. We would also like to register as many doctors and pharmacies as possible with our website to help all people all around the world with their problems. We further plan to get the posts on the discussion forum verified by doctors, and make sure that the myths in practices of AYUSH are removed. Instead of generating a Google Meet link for doctor-patient consultation, an additional video communication software is planned to be created, in order to make the process of online consultation seamless.
